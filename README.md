## Overview 
ðŸŽ¤ ðŸŽ¤ Welcome to our project for the ETHGlobal Bangkok 2024 Hackathon, where we bring K-pop fans, blockchain tech, and a sprinkle of Web3 magic together! ðŸŽ‰

Whatâ€™s the big idea? Weâ€™re using Scrollâ€™s L1Sload feature (a fancy tool that lets L2s read data from L1) to let fans vote for their favorite idolâ€™s center position in a decentralized, secure, and undeniably fun way. ðŸš€âœ¨

### Why This Project?
This whole thing started when we saw the amazing Scrollâ€™s L1Sload proposal and the shiny CDP x HYBE prize for creator-economy projects. Thatâ€™s when the lightbulb moment happened:

L1 has loads of trusted data, like NFTs!
L2 is where all the fun happensâ€”faster, cheaper, and cooler.
So, we asked ourselves: What if fans could use an L1 NFT (proof theyâ€™re a real stan) to vote for their idol on L2? Suddenly, we were building a playground for K-pop fans and showing off how L2s can flex their muscles in practical, real-world use cases.

### How It Works
Get your qualification badge (NFT): Fans need a K-pop NFT on L1.
Hop onto L2: Thanks to L1Sload, we pull in that NFT data without making you break the bank on gas fees.
Vote for the center position: Fans can cast votes on L2 to decide who gets the spotlight. All the votes and interactions are securely stored on L2.
Results go live: The top idol earns their spot in the middle, because democracy never sounded so catchy! ðŸŽ¶

### Why This Matters
K-pop stans are serious about their idols (and so are we). By combining L1â€™s trust with L2â€™s scalability, weâ€™re creating a decentralized, gas-friendly way for fans to engage. But the real kicker? This is a proof of fun for what L2s can do when they use L1Sload creatively. Imagine a future where L2s are playgrounds for fun, engaging, and powerful Web3 applications. The possibilities are endless! ðŸš€


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
